    "\n",
    "1. You can add a new cell by clicking on the \"+\" icon on top.\n",
    "2. You can delete a cell by selecting that cell and clicking on the \"scissors\" icon on top.\n",
    "3. You can execute a cell by either pressing shift+enter or selecting the \"play\" button on top.\n",
    "4. You can create a new file in Jupyter via the File menu->New Notebook option. Make sure to select Python 2 when creating your notebook.\n",
    "5. Also, for your code blocks make sure that Code is selected instead of another option like Markdown.\n",
    "6. Use the Enter key to go to the next line in a cell to enter the next statement.\n",
    "7. You can clear results by clicking on the Cell menu item and selecting Current Output->Clear or All Output->Clear depending on whether you are trying to just clear the output for one cell or for all cells.\n",
    "8. In case your program has crashed for some reason (infinite loop, for example), you can restart your Python session by select Kernel in the menu and selecting Restart.\n"

Classes allow for the creation of processing of large data structures and applying common functions that are relevant to those structures. Also Classes allows for restricting access to information, for example to functions created in the Class. A class is the foundation of Object Oriented programming. In Python almost all types are derived from a Class, and Python in general is designed as an object Oriented language. Classes also allow overloading of functions depending on Class type and allow class inheritance, thereby building more specific classes on top of other classes without having to rebuild every property.

A good example of this is variables of an object of a Class can be made to be modified using only fucntions in the class, thus restricting access to these variables, and preventing the data from being modified inadvertently."
