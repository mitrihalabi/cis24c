    "Below are some useful commands to know when using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can add a new cell by clicking on the \"+\" icon on top.\n",
    "2. You can delete a cell by selecting that cell and clicking on the \"scissors\" icon on top.\n",
    "3. You can execute a cell by either pressing shift+enter or selecting the \"play\" button on top.\n",
    "4. You can create a new file in Jupyter via the File menu->New Notebook option. Make sure to select Python 2 when creating your notebook.\n",
    "5. Also, for your code blocks make sure that Code is selected instead of another option like Markdown.\n",
    "6. Use the Enter key to go to the next line in a cell to enter the next statement.\n",
    "7. You can clear results by clicking on the Cell menu item and selecting Current Output->Clear or All Output->Clear depending on whether you are trying to just clear the output for one cell or for all cells.\n",
    "8. In case your program has crashed for some reason (infinite loop, for example), you can restart your Python session by select Kernel in the menu and selecting Restart.\n"

    "\n",
    "2- The key in a dictionary is very arbitrary and based on any element that can be hashed, searching in a dictionary is based on that key. The key in a list is referred to as an index, it is not dsiplayed as part of the list, but it is based on the order of the elements of the list and starts at number zero for the first element index and goes up or it can start from -1 for the last element and goes down from there. So there is an order to a list based on the index, you can insert elements or delete elements based on that index order. In a dictionary element searching is based on key hashing and there is no order for the element search."
